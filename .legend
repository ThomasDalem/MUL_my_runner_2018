------Map creation description-------
-------------------------------------

The map height must be 10 characters tall

0 is for blocks -> You can run on it but if you run and hit them from the left you will die.
                   They should be used as floor.

1 is for spikes -> If you hit them from any directions, you will die.
                   The best way to use them is to put them directly on the top of the blocks.
                   But you can do whatever you want with them and put them anywhere, it's up to you.

3 is for end    -> If you hit the end you will win the game, it's a big sprite, you should try
                   to put it in a place without blocks but it's not a problem if you put it with blocks
                   around it.

You can put holes on the bottom floor like this : 0000000     00000000, if the player falls in them,
he will die.
